# Google Maps Reviews App Fixes

This repository contains fixes for the Google Maps Reviews application that was experiencing several errors.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Supabase Database Fixes

- Created the missing `saved_recommendations` table
- Added the required `create_recommendations_table` function
- Set up row-level security policies for the tables

### 2. Edge Function Implementation

- Added a new Edge Function for generating recommendations when the AI services fail
- Includes CORS headers to prevent browser blocking

### 3. Frontend Code Fixes

- Fixed the aiWorker.js file by adding the missing `aiWorkerTasks` object
- Updated the GeminiProvider to handle API connection errors gracefully
- Added key props to list items in RecommendationsDashboard
- Added null checks for theme objects in GrowthStrategiesView

## How to Implement

1. Run the SQL migrations in your Supabase project
2. Deploy the Edge Function to your Supabase project
3. Update your frontend code with the fixed files
4. Configure CORS in your Supabase project settings

## CORS Configuration

Ensure your Supabase project has CORS configured to allow requests from your development server:

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to Project Settings > API
2. Under "CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)", add `http://localhost:8080` to the allowed origins
